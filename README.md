     - Delete tasks that are no longer relevant.
  3. **Dashboard for Analysis:**  
     - View task-related data in an interactive dashboard, providing insights into task status, progress, and other critical metrics.

- **Features on the Task Page:**

  - **Search and Filter Functionality:**  
    Workers can use the same search and filter options available to Assigners, including sorting by:
    - Title/Description keywords
    - Status, priority, and creation date
